Problem Statement: Extracting trends from social media


## Cover Letter
I am currently prusing my B.Tech from Rajiv Gandhi university of knowledge Technologies, Srikakulam
I am really passionate about machine learning and deep learning. I started my learning journey from my 1st year B.Tech on my own. Now I am looking forward to work with industrial experts. I came to know about ZEP analytics and it is very inspiring, I hope it is a best platform to enhance my skill set. Even though I am a fresher I need to know the work and to use my skills over industrial problems. I am expecting a good reply from you.
